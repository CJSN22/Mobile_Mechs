Purpose:

A webapp designed for the avid cyclist/high end bike consumer making it convenient for them by providing a variety of services right at their front door or wherever they are located (events, warehouse, etcâ€¦).  They will not have to go through the hassle of having to bring their bikes to a local shop. 

Technologies used:

React js, Bootstrap, CSS, APIs, Python, Flask.

Cool Features:

Services will be rendered at location where the customer would like and also a full inspection to keep them up to date with any parts, updates or upgrades that would be needed and leaving them with the option if they wanted to perform these services for a fee.  Upon completion of the work to their bike and payment completed, the app will record the service visit with all services performed and will keep customer updated through a schedule that will keep them current with future service dates for all parts while maintaining a close mechanic/customer relationship.

Future additions :

Creating a tracking feature that takes data from our external API (Strava) which creates an alert that will allow us to keep track of miles ridden and type of bike.  This will allow us to proactively reach out to cyclist and provide services needed based on this information.
